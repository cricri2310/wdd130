    <h2> Cristian Collado</h2>
    <h2> Cris for friends haha</h2>
    <p> I am from Peru, especifically in Lima. I came to the United States when I was 17, that is 3 years ago.</p>
    <p> However, in 2022 I went back to Peru to serve a mission in Chiclayo, which is a city in the north part of Peru.</p>
    <p> I am studying Software Engineering, and this is my second semester at BYUI. I am enjoying this career so far, I hope I feel the same on the next semesters haha.</p>
    <p> I love to play soccer, and to produce music. I am trying to get back to soccer, because I have not been able to practice too much, since the mission.</p>
