        <h3>Peruvian Cuisine</h3>
        <p>
          Peruvian cuisine is like a boom of mixed flavors and traditions that
          have been influenced by a lot of different cultures over the years.
          Originally, Peru's ancient civilizations, such as the Incas, based
          their food on local ingredients such as potatoes, corn and quinoa. In
          fact, potatoes come from Peru, where there are more than 3,000
          different types. They also ate fish from the coast and guinea pig,
          which was one of the main sources of protein in the Andes.When the
          Spanish arrived, they brought their own ingredients and culinary
          techniques, which completely changed Peruvian food. The Spaniards
          introduced beef, chicken and citrus fruits, and also brought African
          slaves, who brought their own flavors and recipes into the mix. This
          blend of Spanish, African and native traditions gave rise to a whole
          new style of cooking, in which ingredients were combined in novel
          ways, creating dishes such as anticuchos (grilled meat skewers) and
          aji de gallina (a creamy, spicy chicken dish).Later, immigrants from
          China and Japan brought their own influence to Peruvian gastronomy.
          The Chinese introduced stir-fry, which they mixed with local
          ingredients to create chifa, a Chinese-Peruvian fusion cuisine popular
          in Peru today. Japanese immigrants inspired dishes such as ceviche,
          the famous Peruvian dish of raw fish marinated in lime juice, which
          has both Japanese and Peruvian roots. All these influences make
          Peruvian food one of the most diverse and richest cuisines in the
          world, with traditional recipes that have grown and changed over the
          centuries to become totally unique.
