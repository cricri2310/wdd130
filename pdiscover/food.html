            <h3>Places you find in Peru</h3>
            <p>
              Peru has some of the most beautiful scenery on the planet, with a mix of history and natural beauty that make it an incredible place to visit. First, the Andes Mountain range, where Machu Picchu, the ancient Inca city, is visible to all tourists. Climbing up there is like visiting the Inca culture and finding landscapes like in a movie. The Sacred Valley is full of green hills and ancient ruins where the Incas farmed on huge terraces carved into the mountain slopes. This place has been chosen as one of the 7 wonders of the world. Then there is the Amazon jungle, which is huge and totally different. The Peruvian part of the Amazon is one of the most biodiverse places in the world, with pink dolphins, giant trees and so many different plants and animals that you probably won't see anywhere else. This part of Peru is very remote; you must take a boat to get into the jungle, but the adventure is worth it! And if you like mysterious things, in the coastal desert are the Nazca Lines, huge animal figures drawn in the sand thousands of years ago. No one knows exactly why they were made, and you can only see the complete designs from above, which is pretty mind-blowing.

            <h3>Peruvian Cuisine</h3>
            <p>
              Peruvian cuisine is like a boom of mixed flavors and traditions that have been influenced by a lot of different cultures over the years. Originally, Peru's ancient civilizations, such as the Incas, based their food on local ingredients such as potatoes, corn and quinoa. In fact, potatoes come from Peru, where there are more than 3,000 different types. They also ate fish from the coast and guinea pig, which was one of the main sources of protein in the Andes.When the Spanish arrived, they brought their own ingredients and culinary techniques, which completely changed Peruvian food. The Spaniards introduced beef, chicken and citrus fruits, and also brought African slaves, who brought their own flavors and recipes into the mix. This blend of Spanish, African and native traditions gave rise to a whole new style of cooking, in which ingredients were combined in novel ways, creating dishes such as anticuchos (grilled meat skewers) and aji de gallina (a creamy, spicy chicken dish).Later, immigrants from China and Japan brought their own influence to Peruvian gastronomy. The Chinese introduced stir-fry, which they mixed with local ingredients to create chifa, a Chinese-Peruvian fusion cuisine popular in Peru today. Japanese immigrants inspired dishes such as ceviche, the famous Peruvian dish of raw fish marinated in lime juice, which has both Japanese and Peruvian roots. All these influences make Peruvian food one of the most diverse and richest cuisines in the world, with traditional recipes that have grown and changed over the centuries to become totally unique.
